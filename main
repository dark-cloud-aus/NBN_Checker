# This is a simple unofficial Python script that programmatically lookups an address in Australia and outputs the
# NBN connection details such as the connection type, service type, connection status and more.
# This script is not official and has been made as a project to learn scripting and is in no way affiliated with or
# approved by the NBN network.


# import modules needed
import pprint
from nbnpy.nbn import NBN

# Ask the user for their address
address = input("What is the address?: ")
nbn_client = NBN()

# pass address variable through location_ids
location_ids = nbn_client.get_location_ids_from_address(address)
location_id = location_ids["suggestions"][0]["id"]

# Output from address
location_info = nbn_client.location_information(location_id)
pprint.pprint(location_info)

# This code is not affiliated with NBN in anyway whatsoever. This script has been written just for fun and testing.
